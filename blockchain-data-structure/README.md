# BLOCKCHAIN DATA STRUCTURE

## 1: Blocks and Hashes
### Your Goal: Return a Hash
- In your Block.js file, we have a class Block. Using the SHA256 function from the Crypto JS Library, return a valid hash in the toHash function.

- For now, there's no need to hash anything in particular since the block contains none of the components we mentioned above.
